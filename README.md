# Hi there 👋, I am Matheus Pinheiro

## 📖 About Me
Hello there! I am Matheus Calixto Vaz Pinheiro.<br>
Software engineer with a focus on front-end development, looking for professional and personal growth opportunities. Taking on challenges will be my route to achieving this, which I am eager to do. Furthermore, I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and knowledge of the technologies I use and those that are emerging. 

My best qualities are generosity, leadership, perseverance, communication and proactivity.
My best technologies are React, React Native and Redux.

  * Here I work with React, React Native, Redux, Javascript, Typescript and Material UI. My responsibilities are to develop new features, fix bugs and improve the codebase. To make that improvements I use the best practices of the technologies and the best practices of software development. And to do that I dialogue with the team and the product owner to understand the needs and the best way to implement the features.
